CSIRT training center: Blacked-out PDF
======================================

## Task
Hi, CSIRT trainee,

verify that the HR department sufficiently blacks-out personal information in published documents - for example, you can use an official apology form for a security incident.

## Solution
In the end of PDF document is several records blacked-out. But apparently text layer in document is present. When PDF is opened in default PDF browser in Gnome (evince), just selecting the black text reveals it's content. So just select Incident ID and copy/paste the flag: FLAG{uBlQ-wB81-0Bhr-2ylo}
